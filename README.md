üîπ 4. How can you highlight text in HTML?
Answer:
If you are working with an HTML5 page, the <mark> tag can be a quick and easy way of highlighting or marking text on a page:

<mark>highlighted text</mark>
To highlight text with just HTML code and support for all browsers, set the background-color style, as shown in the example below, using the HTML tag.

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Yellow text.</span>
<hr>

 üîπ 5. What is Character Encoding?
Answer:
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set (character encoding) to use. This is specified in the tag:

HTML5:
<meta charset="UTF-8"> <hr>

üîπ 6. What is a self closing tag?
Answer:
In HTML5 it is not strictly necessary to close certain HTML tags. The tags that aren‚Äôt required to have specific closing tags are called ‚Äúself closing‚Äù tags.

An example of a self closing tag is something like a line break (<br />) or the meta tag (<meta>). This means that the following are both acceptable:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
...
<meta charset="UTF-8" /> <hr>

 üîπ 07. How Can I Get Indexed Better by Search Engines?
Answer:
It is possible to get indexed better by placing the following two statements in the <HEAD> part of your documents:

<META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="keyword keyword keyword keyword">
<META NAME="description" CONTENT="description of your site">
Both may contain up to 1022 characters. If a keyword is used more than 7 times, the keywords tag will be ignored altogether. Also, you cannot put markup (other than entities) in the description or keywords list.
 
 üîπ 08. Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements: header, article, section, footer
Answer:
<header> is used to contain introductory and navigational information about a section of the page. This can include the section heading, the author‚Äôs name, time and date of publication, table of contents, or other navigational information.

<article> is meant to house a self-contained composition that can logically be independently recreated outside of the page without losing it‚Äôs meaining. Individual blog posts or news stories are good examples.

<section> is a flexible container for holding content that shares a common informational theme or purpose.

<footer> is used to hold information that should appear at the end of a section of content and contain additional information about the section. Author‚Äôs name, copyright information, and related links are typical examples of such content.
 
 
 üîπ 08. What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property" in HTML?
Answer:
Attributes are defined on the HTML markup but properties are defined on the DOM. To illustrate the difference, imagine we have this text field in our HTML: <input type="text" value="Hello">.

const input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello
But after you change the value of the text field by adding "World!" to it, this becomes:

console.log(input.getAttribute('value')); // Hello
console.log(input.value); // Hello World!
 <hr>
 
 üîπ 09. What does a DOCTYPE do?
Answer:
DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for ‚Äúdocument type‚Äù. It is a declaration used in HTML to distinguish between standards mode and quirks mode. Its presence tells the browser to render the web page in standards mode.

Moral of the story - just add <!DOCTYPE html> at the start of your page.
